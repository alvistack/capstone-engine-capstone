Description: lightweight multi-architecture disassembly framework - devel files
 Capstone is a lightweight multi-platform, multi-architecture disassembly
 framework. These are the development headers and libraries.
 Features:
 - Support hardware architectures: AArch64, ARM, Alpha, BPF, EVM, HPPA, LongArch, M680X, M68K, MOS65XX, Mips, PowerPC, RISCV, SH, Sparc, SystemZ, TMS320C64x, TriCore, WASM, x86, XCore.
 - Clean/simple/lightweight/intuitive architecture-neutral API.
 - Provide details on disassembled instructions (called "decomposer" by some
 others).
 - Provide some semantics of the disassembled instruction, such as list of
 implicit registers read & written.
 - Thread-safe by design.
 - Special support for embedding into firmware or OS kernel.
 - Distributed under the open source BSD license.
